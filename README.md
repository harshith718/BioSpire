# BioSpire

BioSpire is a compact evolutionary simulation engine designed to explore how sequences mutate, adapt, and improve over generations. It models mutation rates, selection pressure, evolutionary fitness scoring, and trajectory visualization. This project is part of a larger 6-project evolution research portfolio built independently.
